# MMFR
Monarrk's Mysterious File Repo

# What is This?
A simple package manager mostly made for messing around during my math class.

# Usage
To update the package list:

	`mmfr update`

To find a file:

	`mmfr find keyword`

To download a file:
(note, must have synced packages on your machine with `mmfr update` first)

	`mmfr get ${package}`
	
This will add the package to mmfr/bin.
