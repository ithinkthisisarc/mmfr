# MMFR
Monarrk's Mysterious File Repo

# What is This?
A simple package manager mostly made for messing around during my math class.

# Usage
To update the package list:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`mmfr update`

To find a file:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`mmfr find keyword`

To download a file:
(note, must have synced packages on your machine with `mmfr update` first)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`mmfr get ${package}`

To get a pre-compiled file from the repository for MAC or LINUX, use the options `-m` for mac or `-l` for linux
	
This will add the package to mmfr/bin.
